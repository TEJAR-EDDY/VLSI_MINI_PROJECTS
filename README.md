# VLSI Mini Projects in Verilog HDL üöÄ

This repository contains self-developed **VLSI mini projects** implemented in **Verilog HDL**.  
These projects were created as part of a **self-learning journey** to strengthen RTL design, digital logic, and verification skills.  
Each project includes Verilog design files, testbenches, and simulation support.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Projects

1. **Clone this Repository**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/TEJAR-EDDY/VLSI_MINI_PROJECTS_FE.git
    cd VLSI_MINI_PROJECTS_FE
    ```

2. **Navigate to Any Project Folder**
    ```
    cd traffic_light_controller
    ```

3. **Compile the Design and Testbench**
    ```
    iverilog -o sim_out design.v testbench.v
    ```

4. **Run the Simulation**
    ```
    vvp sim_out
    ```

5. **View the Waveform**
    ```
    gtkwave dump.vcd
    ```

## üìñ Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, the following skills were gained:
- RTL design and Verilog HDL coding
- Testbench development and simulation
- FSM-based digital system design
- Memory architecture (RAM, ROM, FIFO)
- Waveform analysis with GTKWave
- Debugging and verification at IP level
