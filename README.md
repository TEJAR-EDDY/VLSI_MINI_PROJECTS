# VLSI Mini Projects in Verilog HDL üöÄ

This repository contains a collection of **VLSI mini projects** that I designed and verified in **Verilog HDL** as part of my **self-learning journey**.  
The projects cover **fundamental digital design concepts** such as memory, FSMs, controllers, and data flow.  

Each project includes:
- RTL design in Verilog
- Testbench for simulation
- VCD waveform output (for GTKWave)

## üìÇ Project List

1. **[Dual Port RAM & ROM](./dual_port_ram_rom_a_s)**  
   - Implements dual-port memory modules (RAM and ROM).  
   - Supports simultaneous read/write.  
   - Helps understand memory design concepts.  

2. **[Single Port RAM & ROM](./single_port_ram_rom_a_s)**  
   - Implements single-port memory modules.  
   - Focus on address, control, and data path understanding.  

3. **[Synchronous & Asynchronous FIFO](./synchronous_asynchronous_fifo)**  
   - Designs a FIFO buffer with synchronous and asynchronous clocking.  
   - Key learning: metastability, data buffering, and flow control.  

4. **[Traffic Light Controller](./traffic_light_controller)**  
   - FSM-based controller for traffic lights.  
   - Demonstrates state transitions and timing control.  

5. **[Vending Machine Controller](./vending_machine_controller)**  
   - FSM design for a vending machine.  
   - Includes coin input recognition and product dispensing logic.  

6. **[Washing Machine Controller](./washing_machine_controller)**  
   - FSM-based washing machine automation.  
   - Covers multiple states like wash, rinse, dry.
