## üìå Project Overview

This project explores the design and verification of **Synchronous** and **Asynchronous FIFO (First-In First-Out) Buffers** using **Verilog HDL**. The goal was to strengthen my learning in digital design and verification while understanding **clock domain crossing (CDC)**, **pointer management**, and **flag generation** for robust data transfer.

FIFO buffers are widely used in:

* Processor‚Äìmemory interfaces
* Communication protocols (e.g., UART)
* Multi-core processor pipelines
* Audio/video streaming systems

This project is part of my **self-learning practice** to gain strong RTL design and verification skills.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Features

* **Synchronous FIFO**

  * Single clock domain
  * Dual-port memory array (16 √ó 8)
  * Full/empty flag detection
  * Simple FSM states: EMPTY, PARTIAL, FULL

* **Asynchronous FIFO**

  * Separate read and write clock domains
  * Gray code counters for safe pointer crossing
  * Double-flip-flop synchronizers to prevent metastability
  * Correct full/empty detection across domains

* **Verification**

  * Testbenches written in Verilog
  * Corner cases tested: reset, full, empty, read/write overlap
  * Random delay injection for async FIFO
  * Waveform dumping (`.vcd`) for GTKWave analysis

## üöÄ How to Run (with Icarus Verilog + GTKWave)

### 1. Compile and run **Synchronous FIFO**

```bash
# Compile
iverilog -o sync_fifo_tb.out src/sync_fifo.v tb/sync_fifo_tb.v
# Run simulation
vvp sync_fifo_tb.out
# View waveform
gtkwave sync_fifo_tb.vcd
```

### 2. Compile and run **Asynchronous FIFO**

```bash
# Compile
iverilog -o async_fifo_tb.out src/async_fifo.v tb/async_fifo_tb.v
# Run simulation
vvp async_fifo_tb.out
# View waveform
gtkwave async_fifo_tb.vcd
```

## üìä Example Simulation Results

### ‚úÖ Synchronous FIFO

* FIFO depth: 16
* Data correctly written and read in FIFO order
* Full/empty flags toggled as expected

*https://github.com/TEJAR-EDDY/VLSI_MINI_PROJECTS_FE/tree/main/synchronous_asynchronous_fifo/Simulation_Results*

### ‚úÖ Asynchronous FIFO

* Independent read/write clocks (125 MHz / 83 MHz)
* Data integrity preserved across domains
* Random delays handled safely using synchronizers
